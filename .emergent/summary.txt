The AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack web application معاً نَبني based on a static HTML template, evolving it with FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The development was iterative, focusing on dynamic content, user authentication, and an admin dashboard. Significant progress included implementing CRUD for the 's Hero section and 's Hero section, alongside ensuring a consistent transparent green background across pages.

A major challenge arose during an attempt to replace Loading... text with an Eagle logo, where  commands corrupted multiple frontend files, leading to a non-functional UI. Extensive  operations and manual debugging were required to restore the codebase. Another critical issue involved incorrect  configuration and  in  files, coupled with Kubernetes ingress routing complexities, which prevented Admin Dashboard login. These were eventually resolved with the help of a backend testing agent and direct  modifications.

Currently, all core features are restored and functional, including dynamic Hero sections and the unified background. The immediate next step involves resolving a display issue on the  where restored text content appears truncated (...) despite being correctly stored.

The goal is a dynamic web application, معاً نَبني (Together We Build), a community solidarity platform for Hama city, derived from a static . It aims to support families, manage in-kind donations, healthcare cases, daily initiatives, family awareness, and educational solidarity. Key requirements included Admin and Donor roles, dynamic content across all sections, a comprehensive Admin Dashboard, and initial donation data recording. UI/UX must adhere to the original static file's styling, including menu structure and logo integration. A dynamic Our Mission page was added with CRUD for its sub-sections and image management. Full CRUD for the 's Hero section, including image upload and video integration, was requested, along with header layout fixes. A consistent transparent green background image was later requested for all hero sections. Finally, loading indicators were to be replaced with an Eagle logo.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Core FastAPI backend. Defines API routes, MongoDB models, and business logic.
    -   **Changes Made:** Extended  model and APIs for  Hero section CRUD (title, subtitle, image, video URL). Added , ,  fields to  model for  Hero section CRUD. Includes image upload API.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores backend environment variables like .
    -   **Changes Made:** Was found missing  during debugging and was subsequently added/fixed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Main React component for routing.
    -   **Changes Made:** Routes dynamically added for all pages.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Global CSS styles.
    -   **Changes Made:** Modified  class to apply a consistent transparent green background image across the application.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Navigation bar.
    -   **Changes Made:** Integrated  and updated menu structure. Layout issues were previously fixed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Main landing page.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated to dynamically fetch and display content for its Hero and Video sections from the backend. Logic to prioritize  from backend over CSS was re-added.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Central administration panel.
    -   **Changes Made:** Added a new tab Hero Section for  Hero & Video content management (CRUD for text, images, video URL), including instructional text. Added a Hero Section management block within the Mission tab for  (CRUD for title, subtitle, image).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays dynamic Our Mission content.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated to fetch and display dynamic content, including its Hero section with title, subtitle, and image from the backend.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** (Proposed) Component to display an Eagle logo during loading.
    -   **Changes Made:** Created, but its integration led to widespread syntax errors and was reverted. The feature is not currently active.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Stores frontend environment variables, crucially .
    -   **Changes Made:** Was found missing and then created. Incorrectly configured multiple times during debugging, finally set correctly to ensure API requests were routed via ingress.

<pending_tasks>
-   Re-implement the Loading... text replacement with the Eagle logo in all pages, ensuring no syntax errors are introduced.
-   Resolve the  display issue where restored text content appears truncated (...) instead of showing the full text.
-   Finalize the donation recording feature (currently only records, but full processing is deferred).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully restored the application to a fully functional state, including all previously developed features. This involved extensive debugging and  operations to recover from widespread syntax errors introduced during an attempt to implement a  component.

Currently, the Admin Dashboard is fully accessible and functional. The  dynamically displays its Hero and Video sections with content managed from the Admin Dashboard, and uses the unified transparent green background. The  also displays its Hero section dynamically with managed content and the unified background. All data, including mission content, has been successfully restored from a user-provided HTML file into the MongoDB database.

The immediate task is to address a specific display bug on the : although data has been correctly stored and confirmed in the Admin Dashboard, the content on the  frontend appears truncated (e.g., as ...), rather than displaying the full text. The AI is investigating this content display issue by checking the API response.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate the API response for the  to confirm full text content is being sent from the backend.
